# Parabola

A Fabric mod for Minecraft using Kotlin.

## Project Setup

This project uses:
- **Gradle 9.2.1** with Fabric Loom 1.14.10
- **Kotlin 2.3**
- **Java 21**
- **Minecraft 1.21.11**
- **Fabric API** and **fabric-language-kotlin**

## Building

To build the mod, run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

On Windows, use:

```cmd
gradlew.bat build
```

The built JAR will be in the `build/libs/` directory.

## Build Output Directories

### Should `out/` and `build/` be in .gitignore?

**Yes, both should be in .gitignore.**

- **`build/`**: This is Gradle's default build output directory. It contains compiled classes, generated resources, JAR files, and other build artifacts. All of these can be regenerated by running the Gradle build process.

- **`out/`**: This directory is used by IntelliJ IDEA (and some other IDEs) to store compiled classes and build outputs. It's completely separate from Gradle's build process and should never be committed to version control.

### Why exclude them?

1. **Generated content**: Both directories contain only generated files that can be recreated from source code
2. **Large size**: They can grow quite large and would bloat the repository
3. **Environment-specific**: Different developers/build environments may generate different outputs
4. **Conflicts**: Committed build artifacts can cause merge conflicts and unnecessary changes in git status

These directories are standard exclusions for any Java/Kotlin/Gradle project and are already included in most standard .gitignore templates for these technologies.

## Structure

- `src/main/kotlin/` - Kotlin source code
- `src/main/resources/` - Fabric mod resources (fabric.mod.json, mixins, etc.)
- `src/client/kotlin/` - Client-only Kotlin code
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration
